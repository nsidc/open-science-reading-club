## Discussion

* Interested in scheduled learning meetings at NSIDC.  What would these "look" like?++
    * Intentionally naming the meetings - Naming is important!
    * Skilled practitioners at NSIDC
    * Reach out to Openscapes for help!
    * At NSIDC, more effective to co-work around open science skills. For example, folks looking for help with Git, wanting to learn about STAC, new data format, could trigger a learning-together meeting. "Seaside  chat"
    * "Co-working"
    * Originally "seaside chat" came from NCEAS being in Santa Barbara on the ocean and being a group of ocean people
    * "Tea break" every other Friday at 10AM. About helping people get to know their co-workers but resulted in useful discussions. Having a known scheduled time helped with momentum
    * Openscapes Blog on Seaside Chats https://openscapes.org/blog/2019-03-10-seaside-chats/
    * ...and also https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03335-4 (requires vpn)
    * "learning meeting" supporting the mission of NSIDC
        * Benefits may be unexpected / unpredictable / not obvious.
        * Amazed at the breadth of expertise that we all have. There are people in user services with PhDs in geology, atmo sci, cartography, things that often "get lost" because that's not directly part of their job. They could contribute so much more to the center if only they were given the space to do that. How to harness that diversity of expertise and break out of those silos?
        * Open science is about enabling everyone to contribute in their way. How can it work within something like our org where we have a diversity of tasks and job descriptions like at NSIDC?
        * What sort of cross-institute topics are appropriate for group co-learning sessions? We all work with data. Data challenges, ask for help, share experiences.
        * RSE Community Calls have a format with slots for lightning talks (5 minutes) and discussions
        * ‚≠ê One of us has to step up to start this.
        * Big change can take a long time. Starting with smaller more actionable steps can build momentum ("flywheel") towards culture change that self-sustains.
            * Might be easier to start out within NSIDC, with a plan for inviting more people.
        * CIRES inclusive community of practice is a model we could follow to broaden this discussion.
            * Build credibility first, then broaden it to the wider CIRES community.
* Interested in the reference to building better habits (beginning of #2) and building change through small steps+
* "Rapidly, radically reshaping" -- Everyone needs to be on board for this! Sometimes things change slowly, how can we change that?
* References to other publications on practical/concrete steps to get started+
* I appreciated in the article the acknowledgement of the effort, worth it!, but there is work, time and energy that goes into open science, especially in the beginning.++
* I wonder what the efficiencies of shared learning look like across institutions and how to make that a reality. Silos are so easy to have. Is there some sort of emergent phenomena that arises from how we work as individuals.
    * It was mentioned to start with small actions to start building culture. Would be interesting to monitor in some way how this could filter up.
* Bringing different groups, like early adopters and managers/leadership together (p4) -- how can we be intentional about this?
* I thought the concept of Social Infrastructure was interesting and creating shared values in the organization,
* Article mentions morale multiple times. On p2, mentions "identifying as part of the Open Science and climate movements". How can we do more of that? I think we're often really focused on the being recognized part of this, but not so much on the identifying-with part!
* On extra effort - I'm interested in seeing if the effort tends to zero as we start to do open science as default and as an institutional culture.+
* Next steps
    * Continue discussing how we will start having "Co-working" meetings in our next open science reading club meeting
    * Erik to talk to Donna about re-purposing demo meeting
        * This isn't completely "pushing off" demos, just creating a space for other things as well.
    * Do Wednesdays once a month work?
        * 1 month from today is UWG
        * Trey to send out when2meet
