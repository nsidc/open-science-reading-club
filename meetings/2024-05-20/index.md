## Discussion

* Liked the documentation (R Markdown) integrated with code base

* It's rare to have a "forced reproducibility" opportunity for study.

* Data science tools "require a substantial investment to learn" how to get
	buy- in for things that take time to learn

* "Learning together and supporting each other peer-to-peer can be more fun and
	rewarding"

* Treat "future selves as collaborators" 

* At end of paper: "critical for the broader science community to build a
	culture where openness and reproducibility are valued, formally taught and
	practiced, where we all agree that they are worth the investment"
	* How do?

* Engagement as an evolution instead of a revolution +1
	* Incremental changes to workflow while retaining annual deliverables

* I liked the term "Janitor Work".  I often feel like I am cleaning up after
	people when dealing with data.

* "These tools quickly became the keystone of how we work, and have overhauled
	our approach to science, perhaps as much as e-mail did in decades prior. They
	have changed the way we think about science and about what is possible."

* Andy: The OHI team faced a very common problem, but did an uncommon behavior:
	they sought a solution! These people are open to finding new ways of doing
	things and willing to put in the work. +1
	* Building a community means you don't have to do the change yourself. You
		can do the thing you're good at and let others do the thing they're good
		at!

* Nice to see this progress, but a reminder of frustration with some folks that
	don't take this mindset.

* Trey: How much of this was championed by a few experts? Incremental change is
	a valuable foothold for broader changes, exposes value that can't be seen
	otherwise.
	* Onus to push small changes is on us

* Andy: "Checkbox open science"
	* Matt: +1!! Open science is downstream of values. Open science is Inclusivity
	* +1!
	* Checkboxes can prevent folks from being open in principle

* Julia: "What happens when you train your employees and they leave?"
	* Worse: "What happens when you don't train your employees and they stay?"
	* +1000

* Trey: Foster a strong support network [within NSIDC]

* Matt: "Inreach"

* Matt: We should have a holistic workforce development program, a good first
	increment is Git/GitHub skills tailored to our service groups
	* Andy: Can we explore CIRES funding for this.
	* Julia: May be easier to justify/fund outside trainer rather than in-house.
		Also need to justify time of trainees.
